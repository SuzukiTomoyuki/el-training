# Short term goals

- Remove dependency on faraday.
- Complete full [API coverage](api_coverage.md).

# Further on

- Improve the  API reference page, help here:
  http://gnuu.org/2009/11/18/customizing-yard-templates/
- Supporting streams would be great.
- Add a layer to handle pagination, use `Enumerable`.
